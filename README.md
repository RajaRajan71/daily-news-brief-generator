## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (Hosted on Community Cloud)
- **News Source:** GNews (Aggregating from BBC, Reuters, The Verge, etc.)
- **AI Engine:** Hugging Face Inference API (BART Transformer Model)
- **Backend:** Python 3.x

## 🧠 Core Features & Documentation

### 1. Preference Handling Logic
The application uses a **Sidebar Preference Manager**. User selections (e.g., Technology, Business) are captured via a multiselect widget. These preferences are used to dynamically filter news queries, ensuring the home page displays only relevant content by default as per the project requirements.

### 2. News Aggregation Approach
We utilize a **Multi-Source Aggregation** strategy. Instead of a single RSS feed, the system queries the GNews library to pull the top 3 high-authority articles per segment from the last 24 hours. This ensures a diverse range of perspectives and real-time reliability.

### 3. AI Summarization & Neutrality
To provide concise insights, the app employs an **Abstractive Summarization** model (`bart-large-cnn`). 
- **Wait-for-Model Logic:** Implemented to handle free-tier API cold starts.
- **Neutrality:** The model is tasked with factual compression, focusing on core reporting to maintain unbiased delivery.

## 🏃 Sample User Flow
1. **Landing:** User opens the app and sees a default brief for their pre-set categories.
2. **Personalize:** User opens the sidebar to add or remove news segments (e.g., adding "Politics").
3. **Generate:** The app fetches the latest news for the new segment and generates AI summaries on the fly.
4. **Deep Dive:** User reads the concise AI summary and can click "Read More" to visit the original source.
